# Overview
In order to showcase and utilize basic knowledge this project entailed the creation of a simple web application that brought together the three tier layer, utilizing HTML, PHP and SQL. The project entailed building a simple search form for vocabulary words with some minimal features built in.

# Additional Details
This project is simple but is meant to showcase the ability to work with all layers, hosting via AwardSpace, phpMyAdmin for data base creation and coding using HTML/PHP and SQL. Provided the simplicity all code is in one file when in reality code would be in separate files and called with in one file. This should give a good understanding of the knowledge base for the ecosystem and how front end and back end applications are applied for web based functionality. I am only including the main code block and am not including the data base tables or actionable files.
